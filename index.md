# LED Text Display
My project is a LED light board that displays text based on input from a keyboard immediately after recieving it. This project requires an application of electronics, firmware, mechanics, and coding to complete. Some of the parts included are an LED dot matrix, Arduino, wood, and

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Starter Project
My starter project was a "useless machine". This machine works by having a plastic arm revert a switch to its original position after a person manually changes it. In order to make the machine, I had to assemble a PCB by soldering various parts, including the switch, as well as attaching said PCB to a motor, plastic arm, and battery so it could work. When flicking the switch, the battery would power motor, moving the arm to flick the switch off again. The hardest part of this process for me was the wiring, as well as the soldering, because my original PCB board did not work. Another difficult part was the assembly of the box that the wire was in, because of the unpredictable self-tapping screws and the corner posts, which made the rest of the box unstable.
